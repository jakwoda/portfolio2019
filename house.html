          <h1>Road to
                House of Lucy</h1>
<p>House of Lucy is an informal collective based around electronic music scene. It formed naturally over time through making music, videos, gatherings. Below I will try to show you briefly the journey we had past two years.

        When Matt told me about his ambient album telling a story of enlightenment I already knew I want to 
        make it visual. We tried to think how to tell both personal and universal story. We decided to disguise him behind a morphsuit.
       We took the green screen attire and travelled Poland looking for sacred and beautiful
        Places that tell a story of lonely wanderer. 
        
        Durifn those trips we got to know each other better and started working on music projects together. We did 5 EP’s
        that year alone.

<p>
        First mini-album we conceptualised during the trip was polski dom which means polish house. It was aimed to be an album telling a story of 5 houses. Each of house songs has a video that corresponds to depicted house. It got released through regime brigade label.

        During that time we were making a tradition of organising a party in the middle of the year in opposition to New Years Eve. We called it Lucy’s from namesday. 2019 edition of non profit charity party  brought together over 200 of people. With 20 dj’s playing non stop for one 24 hours, 6 live acts, place for graffiti artists, skateboarders and everyone else; we realised our utopian dream in a garden of a suburban house.

        We also started making music as House of Lucy at some point. Right now we made 2 albums together. Our Idea is that anything is possible. We try to show it in our music which is both inclusive and exclusive. Both meditative and dancable. It’s outsider music that might appeal to wider audience. The cube at Lucyna was a temple dedicated to that feeling. We then tried to simulate the house of Lucy as a cube constructed from wood in a smaller scale . We then  put on an exhibition in Kunstcenen.xyz in Copengagen with corresponding text and tools to make your own.
