          <h1>tryboarding</h1>
<p>The term originated in the nineties around the skateboard
        community. It describes the act of trying to perform
        an evolution for a long time.A lot of people think that skateboarders  usually land their tricks. 
        But it’s quite the opposite.  Failing, getting up and doing. 
        It all over again is what happens most of the time.

        <section id="section-2">
          <h1>social media</h1>
<p>First thing to do was film and publish tryboarding through
        internet. Gaining audience; showcasing fresh tries
        on the streets that make skaters look at it differently.

          <h1>videos</h1>
<p>Focusing on the process of trying rather the actually 
        succesful tricks.
        When 5-0 try boarding lunched over 2 years ago;
        It aimed to document how skateboarding really looks.
        
        As  it turned out try boarding was a great educational tool
        That was interesting even for non-skaters. 
        
        We started to release longer ambient-like almost 
        Lifestyle videos documenting various trips. Creating 
        alternative skate videos

          <h1>Zine</h1>
<p>
    
        After that we made a zine about places where you can 
        practice tryboarding. There are few well known to skaters.
        Each one consists off picture, title, 
        link to google street view,
        suggestions of tricks you can try there.<br>
        5-0 is a skateboarding trick 

        5-0 is slang for police 
        
        
        
        Exploring that relation was main theme of my photography diploma
        For which I have did concrete frames for my pictures of 
        policeman on try boarding spots.

        <section id="section-5">
          <h1>exhibition</h1>
<p>After that we decided to make an Tryboarding exhibition. 
        Due to it’s unique location and climate we wanted to make it 
        In Osiadle Domków Fińskich na jazdowie. It all worked out. 
        
        Aim of the exhibition was to show the history of try boarding 
        We also wanted for  people experience it personally through 
        Creating pieces of art on the spot. 
        We ensured that the atmosphere does not exclude and 
        Makes for a good place to explore, creat and try. 
        
        We proved that ideas discovered in try boarding can be 
        Transferred to other areas in life and make all more 
        enjoyable.

          <h1>competition</h1>

<p>Later we organised a try boarding competition. 
        It was based around a theme of being deathly. 
        Everybody being a winner. 
        It was a manifest in itselff. 
        We mad  a 3d printed trophy. 
        To be exact half of a trophy/</p>        </section>
